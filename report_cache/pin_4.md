**4. Mitigation Suggestions**
Given the current conditions and trends, it is recommended to monitor the location closely for further increases in water levels. If the trend continues, consider deploying flood barriers or other mitigation measures to protect vulnerable infrastructure. Inform local residents and businesses about the potential flood risk and advise them to take necessary precautions.
