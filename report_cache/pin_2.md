**DETECTION POINT REPORT:**

1. **Hazard Severity**
   - Current Threat Level: No Flood (Level 0)
   - Confidence: Low (Combined Score: 0.080)

2. **Environmental Context**
   - There is a significant decrease in temperature (-5.0C) and a considerable drop in pressure (-21.0 hPa), which could indicate a potential weather change. 
   - Humidity has increased by 10.0%, suggesting increased moisture in the environment. 
   - The slow motion detected might be due to calm weather conditions or low water flow, aligning with the current flood classification.

3. **Temporal Trends**
   - The recent frames show a trend from "No Flood" to "Some Water", with scores increasing from 0.104 to 0.359, then decreasing to 0.195. 
   - This indicates a possible increase in water presence, although the latest frame returned to a "No Flood" state.

4. **Mitigation Suggestions**
   - Given the low flood threat level and confidence score, no immediate action is required. 
   - However, due to the environmental changes and temporal trends, it is recommended to monitor the situation closely. 
   - If the trend of increasing water presence continues, consider preparing for potential flood mitigation measures.
